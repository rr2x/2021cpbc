Pandas = huge library for data analysis (files, visualizations)

Openpyxl = designed specifically for excel (formulas, etc.)

Goole Sheets Python API = edit spreadshets hosted at google

PyPDF2 = for reading PDF files
         PDF files are too sensitive, that's why there are paid
         libraries to take care of complexities on compatibility
         (if pdf is scanned/ocr, we can't read it properly)
         if manipulating PDFs, just use a paid library

>> pip install PyPDF2

PEP 8:
  4 space for indentation
  79 max character per line

  vscode settings.json:
      "[python]": {
        "editor.tabSize": 4,
        "editor.insertSpaces": true,
        "editor.rulers": [
          79
        ]
      }

data structures: can hold multiple data types or data objects
  Dictionaties (dict), unordered key:value pairs, {"k":"v"}
  Tuples (tup), ordered immutable sequence of objects, (1,"2",3.3)
  Sets (set), unordered collection of unique objects, {"d","e"}

dynamic typing: reassign variables to different data types
type(...)  = to determine the type


indexing = grab single character on string using square brackets
can do reverse indexing using by using negative values

indexing: [index]
substring: [start:stop:step]
  start: where you start
  stop: where you stop but not include
  step: size of the "jump" you take

"f strings", or "formatted string literals"
introduced in python 3.6

Lists: ordered sequence, can hold objects
uses [val1,val2]

Dictionaties: unordered mapping... has key-value pairing,  grab objects by key
uses {key1:val1, key2:val2}

Dictionary vs List

dictionary is cannot be sorted but easily retrieve object by key
list is retrieved by location and can be sorted/indexed/sliced
